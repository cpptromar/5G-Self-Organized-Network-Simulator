/*	The Antenna class functions as a container for the transceivers that connect to 
 *	the userequipment. The antennae are generated only in the construction of the BS.
 *	
 *	antID: This represents the place in the BaseStation's BSAntennae vector that the antenna is in.
 *	loc: The exact location of the antenna in the environment
 *	antAngle: This is the angle of the antenna relatvie to the BaseStation. This is always some multiple of 2PI/#Antenna per BS.
 *	connectionInfo: This is the container for the transceivers, which can be viewed as the connections to the UEs. To see more go to TransceiverList.h.
